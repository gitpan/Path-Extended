Revision history for Path-Extended

0.02 2008/10/27
  - now Path::Extended::Dir ignores only dot files/directories
    under the target directory while looking for something.
    (i.e. don't care if they are under .cpan directory)

0.02 2008/10/26
  - requires IO 1.27 to support "say"
  - dir->seek isn't always zero
  - loosened dir->find(_dir) tests which look like
    a bit too strict

0.01 2008/10/23
  - initial release
